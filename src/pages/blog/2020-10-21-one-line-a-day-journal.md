**I worked with a team of 6 developers to produce this react application. We were split up into different groups marketing, frontend, and backend. I worked with the front-end team and we used React to produce an application where users can enter a journal entry each day. Users are also able to view a history of every entry they entered on a specific date for 10 years to help potentially detect a pattern of behavior**
